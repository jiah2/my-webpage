        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Loidel Jiah T. Perez, and I am an IT student at Eastern Visayas State University, Ormoc City Campus. I am 19 years old, and I have a deep love for music. My favorite English song is "Listen" by Beyoncé, a powerful anthem of self-expression, while my favorite Tagalog song is "Sino Nga Ba Siya" by Sarah Geronimo, which resonates deeply with its heartfelt lyrics.
I started singing when I was 5 years old. When I became a teenager, I sang in our church and became a worship leader at a young age. Recently, I became the vocalist of a band called Binary Beats. My sister invited me to join, along with a close friend and a classmate. At first, I hesitated because I lacked confidence and felt shy, but I decided to give it a try. To my surprise, we won 2nd place in the Battle of the Bands during our acquaintance party. This experience has inspired me to explore more opportunities and grow in my passion for singing. Beyond music, I also have multiple talents, such as creating slogans and drawing. I can play instruments like the guitar and drums, though only at a basic level. These creative pursuits allow me to express myself in different ways and continue to fuel my passion for learning and growth.</p>

     <p>Welcome to the section dedicated to celebrating our victories! As part of the band Binary Beats, I’m thrilled to share the milestones we’ve achieved together.
